Synchronous code is executed in a single thread, meaning that each statement isexecuted one after 
the other in the order they appear in the code. This means that the next statement
cannot be executed until the previous statement has finished executing.


Asynchronous code, on the other hand, does not have to be executed in a single thread.
This means that multiple statements can be executed at the same time, and the next statement
does not have to wait for the previous statement to finish executing.
